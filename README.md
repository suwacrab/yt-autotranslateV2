# Youtube Auto-Transate V2
Updated version of the original chrome extension that removes the malware.

## Installation

### Manually
Download the repository (`Code` -> `Download ZIP`), unzip it to a folder of your choosing, then go to your web browser's extension settings and choose `Load Packed`.

## Info
Certain videos will have captions off by default; i'd suggest using this along with [another extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-caption/fiaeclpicddpifeflpmlgmbjgaedladf)
