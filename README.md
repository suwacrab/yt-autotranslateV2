# Youtube Auto-Translate V2
updated version of the original chrome extension that removes the malware.
currently works, though all that's needed now is to clean up some of the minified code to make it easier to read.

## Installation

#### Manual
Download the repository (`Code` -> `Download ZIP`), unzip it to a folder of your choosing, then go to your web browser's extension settings and choose `Load Packed`. Select the folder you unzipped the extension into and it should appear.

## Info
Certain videos will have captions off by default; i'd suggest using this along with [another extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-caption/fiaeclpicddpifeflpmlgmbjgaedladf)
